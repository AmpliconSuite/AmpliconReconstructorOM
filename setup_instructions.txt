#This sets up AmpliconReconstuctor and SegAligner as a local command line utility, callable from any directory
#Copy and paste the following commands into your terminal to set up the utility. This adds the AR directories to your bashrc. It is preferred that the user invoke these commands instead of allowing a script to modify a user's bashrc.

#add AmpliconReconstructor and SegAligner to path
echo "export AR_SRC=$PWD" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export SA_SRC=$PWD/SegAligner" >> ~/.bashrc
##USER MUST REPLACE INFORMATION ON THE FOLLOWING LINE
echo "export HG19_DIR=[your directory path containing hg19.fa]" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
echo $AR_SRC
echo $SA_SRC
#alias AmpliconReconstructor
echo "alias AmpliconReconstructor='python2 $AR_SRC/AmpliconReconstructor.py'" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "alias AR='python2 $AR_SRC/AmpliconReconstructor.py'" >> ~/.bashrc
